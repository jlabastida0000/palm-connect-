## Overview

The **Profile Management** system allows users to create, manage, and maintain business profiles within the Palm platform. Additionally, it leverages the **Public Listings API** to provide access to a comprehensive database of business entities aggregated from authoritative government sources. This integration ensures that business profiles are accurate, up-to-date, and compliant with relevant regulations.

## The Profile Object

The Profile object represents a business entity in Palm. It contains basic information, compliance status, and relationships to stakeholders.

```json
{
  "id": "prof_123abc",
  "entityIdNumber": "C1234567",
  "name": "Acme Corporation",
  "entityType": "CORPORATION",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "compliance": {
    "boi": {
      "status": "FILED",
      "filedDate": "2024-01-15"
    }
  }
}
```

## Profile States

Profiles can be in various states throughout their lifecycle:

- `ACTIVE` - Profile is verified and in good standing
- `PENDING` - Profile is awaiting verification
- `INACTIVE` - Profile is not currently active
- `SUSPENDED` - Profile has been temporarily suspended

## Architecture Overview

Understanding the underlying architecture is crucial for effectively managing profiles and leveraging public listings. The system is divided into several layers to ensure data integrity, scalability, and security.

## Core Objects

### Business Listing Object

The `BusinessListing` object represents a consolidated view of publicly available business data:

```typescript
interface BusinessListing {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  business_name: string;         // Legal business name
  dba_names: string[];           // Doing Business As names
  entity_type: string;           // Business structure type
  formation_state: string;       // State of formation
  formation_date: string;        // Date of formation
  status: string;                // Current status
  registered_address: Address;   // Primary address
  mailing_address?: Address;     // Optional mailing address
  entity_number: string;         // State registration number
  jurisdiction: string;          // Registration jurisdiction
  registered_agent?: {
    name: string;
    address: Address;
  };
  data_sources: DataSourceMetadata[];
  industry_categories?: string[];
  location_coordinates?: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  website?: string;
  social_profiles?: SocialProfile[];
  last_verified: string;
  confidence_score: number;
  data_completeness: number;
  is_claimed: boolean;
  claim_status?: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
  has_profile?: boolean;
}
```

### Supporting Types

```typescript
interface Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  zip: string;
  country?: string;
}

interface SocialProfile {
  type: 'linkedin' | 'facebook' | 'twitter' | string;
  url: string;
}

interface DataSourceMetadata {
  source_name: string;
  source_type: 'government' | 'commercial' | 'user-submitted';
  last_updated: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

## Key Features

### Data Quality
- **Normalization**: Data from various sources is standardized into a consistent format.
- **Deduplication**: Advanced entity matching prevents duplicate listings.
- **Enrichment**: Additional data points are added through various sources and APIs.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each listing includes a confidence score based on data quality and verification.

### Search Capabilities
- Full-text search across business names and other fields.
- Geospatial queries for location-based searches.
- Industry and category-based filtering.
- Pagination and sorting options.

### Access Control
- Public endpoints are read-only and require no authentication.
- Claim process allows business owners to verify ownership.
- Verified owners can enhance their listings with additional information.

## Available Endpoints

### Public API
- [Search Listings](/api-reference/listings/search) - Search and filter business listings.
- [Retrieve Listing](/api-reference/listings/retrieve) - Get detailed information about a specific listing.
- [Claim Listing](/api-reference/listings/claim) - Initiate the process of claiming a business listing.

### Profile Management API
- [Create Profile](/api-reference/profiles/create) - Create a new business profile.
- [Retrieve Profile](/api-reference/profiles/retrieve) - Get profile details by ID.
- [Update Profile](/api-reference/profiles/update) - Update an existing profile.
- [List Profiles](/api-reference/profiles/list) - Search and filter profiles.

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint        | Rate Limit                |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Search          | 100 requests per minute   |
| Retrieve        | 200 requests per minute   |
| Claim           | 10 requests per minute    |
| Create Profile  | 50 requests per minute    |
| Update Profile  | 50 requests per minute    |

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad request
- `404` - Resource not found
- `429` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500` - Internal server error

Errors include descriptive messages and unique error codes for troubleshooting.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.",
    "details": {
      "reset_at": "2025-01-31T16:00:00Z",
      "limit": 100,
      "remaining": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Ingestion and Transformation

To ensure the integrity and reliability of business profiles, the system employs a robust data ingestion and transformation pipeline.

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **State Website Scrapers**: Automated tools that collect data from various state websites.
- **Validation Queue**: Ensures incoming data meets predefined quality standards.
- **Raw Data Repository**: Stores unprocessed data for auditing and backup purposes.

### Transformation Layer
- **Normalization**: Standardizes data formats across different sources.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhances profiles with additional information from trusted APIs.
- **Entity Matching**: Identifies and correlates data related to the same business entity.
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate entries to maintain a clean dataset.

### Core Data Storage
- **Business Listings DB**: Central repository for all business listings.
- **Business Profiles DB**: Stores detailed profiles associated with business listings.

### Search Layer
- **Full-text Search Index**: Enables efficient text-based searches.
- **Geospatial Index**: Facilitates location-based queries.

### Access Layer
- **Public API**: Provides read-only access to public users.
- **Private API**: Offers authenticated access for business owners and internal services.
- **Claim System**: Allows business owners to claim and verify their profiles.

## Claim Process

The claim process is essential for business owners to assert ownership and manage their profiles effectively.

1. **Initiate Claim**: Public users can initiate a claim for a business listing through the [Claim Listing API](/api-reference/listings/claim).
2. **Verification**: The system verifies the ownership through provided documentation or automated checks.
3. **Claim Status**: The claim can be in one of the following states:
   - `pending` - Awaiting verification.
   - `verified` - Successfully verified ownership.
   - `rejected` - Verification failed.

Once verified, business owners gain access to additional profile management features, allowing them to update and enrich their business information.
