# Stakeholder Management

## Verification Status

## Ownership Calculations

Palm automatically calculates total ownership percentages:

```typescript
interface OwnershipCalculation {
  direct: number;          // Direct ownership percentage
  indirect: number;        // Indirect ownership through other entities
  total: number;          // Combined ownership percentage
  isBeneficialOwner: boolean; // Whether total ownership exceeds 25%
}
```
